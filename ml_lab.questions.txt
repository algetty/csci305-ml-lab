Lab Questions
=======================
1.	val it = [4,2,5,2,6,10] : int list

2.	The function f adds 1 to each member of the list.

3.	The line `fun f [] = []` defines the function f with the keyword "fun" to
    have an input of type list as well as the output type list.

4.	The line `| f (x::xs) = (x + 1) :: (f xs)` specifies a function body for
    f, which takes in x and xs and puts x + 1 into the list xs.

5.  false

6.  Tail recursion

7.  val it = () : unit
    { it was the best of times, it was the worst of times }

8.  Tail recursion is a recursive call that is performed as the final action of
    a procedure. It can be beneficial to write tail recursing functions because
    tail calls can be implemented without adding a new stack frame to the stack,
    called tail call elimination. This allows for efficient structured
    programming.
